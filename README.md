- The code is in the src directory. 
- Include contains some external utilities that
are used. For compiling the code you will also need the [Eigen library](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/)
version 3 (I am using 3.3).
- Documents contains the report and presentation slides source codes to be compiled with
latex (just run make).
